Mechanical MOOCers,

You may be wondering what it costs us to run the Mechanical MOOC course–after all, we’re helping hundreds of people to learn Python programming. The answer is not much, which is why we can afford to offer the course for free. It costs more or less the fees for our mailgun account, which we estimate to be around a thousand dollars per offering the course. That’s the good news.

The bad news is that the Mechanical MOOC is a volunteer effort without the kind of multimillion dollar backing some other MOOC ventures have. And we’re okay with that. We like it when education is a community effort. Peer 2 Peer U, the group running the mailing list, is paying the fees for it out of their (very modest) non-profit budget. If you are enjoying the course, and learning Python, we’d appreciate any help you can provide in offsetting the program costs. You can donate at: http://info.p2pu.org/donate/ ( http://info.p2pu.org/donate/ ) 

And if you can’t—or don’t want to—hey, we’re cool with that too. We just ask that you use your newfound Python powers for good.

Keep on MOOCin’

The Mechanical MOOC’s A Gentle Introduction to Python is a collaboration between Peer 2 Peer University ( http://p2pu.org ) , MIT OpenCourseWare ( http://ocw.mit.edu ) , OpenStudy ( http://openstudy.com ) , and Codecademy ( http://codecademy.com ) . For this course, Peer 2 Peer University has developed an email scheduler that coordinates student activity across the participating sites to facilitate collaborative learning. This email was generated by the scheduler. A full archive of emails for this course sequence is available here ( http://mechanicalmooc.wordpress.com/category/seq21oct13/ ) .
