Mechanical MOOCians,

We are hoping you’ve enjoyed the course so far, and we know you’ve been working hard.  We know from previous offerings of the course also, that some of you may be running a bit behind by now, so we’ve built a one week break into the middle of the course.  It's also Thanksgiving week in the US and Hanukkah for our Jewish participants, so many of your classmates are spending time with family.

Our goal is to help you learn Python, not to enforce a rigid schedule, so whether you are ahead, keeping pace, or running behind, think of this as your week to do what suits you.  If you are behind, take the time to catch up; if you are on pace or ahead, take a breather, or continue working ahead if you like.  The assignments for the whole course are posted on the course blog ( http://mechanicalmooc.wordpress.com/sequence/ ) .

We’ll resume our regular programming next Monday with the assignment e-mail for Week 6.  Until then, enjoy this week however you choose to spend it.

Yours MOOCfully,

The Mechanical MOOC
