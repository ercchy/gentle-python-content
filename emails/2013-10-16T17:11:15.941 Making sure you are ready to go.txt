Mechanical MOOCers,

People get ready–the course is comin’. In addition to the items in yesterday’s mail, please consider the followings steps:

Watch Monty Python and the Holy Grail.
If you’ve never watched it, you probably should for the life experience, but the programming language Python is named for the comedy troupe Monty Python, and our text and the Codecademy exercises make many references to Monty Python movies, especially …the Holy Grail. If you’ve seen it before, watch it again. It can’t hurt.

Register for each site and create profiles.
Please be sure you are registered for all the sites and have provided lots of fun detail in your profiles.  You should have accounts and profiles on the following sites:


	Openstudy.com ( http://www.openstudy.com ) –Open Study is a social learning site where communities of folks can learn together in forums. You’ll go here if you get stuck and need a quick answer.
	Codecademy.com ( http://www.codeacademy.com ) –Codecademy will have lessons for you to try and write actual Python.
	If you don’t have one, you might also want to set up an account on GitHub ( http://www.github.com ) , so you can easily share code with peers on OpenStudy and in e-mail using GitHub’s Gist.


The Mechanical MOOC also suggests:


	Register for MIT OpenCourseWare newsletter ( http://ocw.mit.edu/jsp/subscribe.jsp )  for updates on what’s going on in the world of OCW.


A tip:  Use the same profile pictures across all of these sites, as well as twitter or other services if you use them, for the duration of the course. This will help peers to recognize you when they bump into you on the various sites and in conversation.

Python on!

–MM
