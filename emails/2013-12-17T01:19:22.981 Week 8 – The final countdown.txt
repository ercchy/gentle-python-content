Mighty MOOCers,

This is it.  The final week’s assignments.  We hope that you’ve learned some Python, made some friends and enjoyed this experiment in a new model for learning.  The final assignment:


	Codecademy: Units 21 – File Input and Output ( http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/python )  
	6.189 Final Project – Tetris! ( http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-189-a-gentle-introduction-to-programming-using-python-january-iap-2011/assignments/MIT6_189IAP11_final_proj.pdf )  


That’s it.  When you’ve done that, you’re done.  But fear not–we’re not going anywhere, so neither should you.  If you are running behind a little, take your time.  If you are done, feel free to hang with us on OpenStudy and continue to help out other learners.  And if you have thoughts about other Mechanical MOOC courses we might offer, let us know.

Thanks for joining us for this leap into a new world of learning.
