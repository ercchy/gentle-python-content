Mechanical MOOCsters,

We are now a week away from the start of the class, which begins June 17th.  We’ve got some warm-ups for you:

Your Tasks:


	Watch Lecture 1 of MIT OpenCourseWare’s 6.00SC ( http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-00sc-introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-spring-2011/unit-1/lecture-1-introduction-to-6.00/ ) . If you’ve programmed before in another language, this will likely be review; if you are entirely new to programming, it covers some foundational concepts.
	Read the Getting Started PDF ( http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-189-a-gentle-introduction-to-programming-using-python-january-iap-2011/lectures/MIT6_189IAP11_start.pdf )  from 6.189 A Gentle Introduction to Python
	Install Python ( http://www.python.org/download/releases/2.6.8/ ) 


Please note:
The Python environment IDLE can be a little disorienting to some users. It has two distinct windows, an “interpreter” window, which has prompts (&gt;&gt;&gt;) and immediately executes commands, and a “program” window, in which you write and save multiple line programs. Save yourself many bangs of your head on your desk by reviewing the following document.

Follow those directions, and in no time, you’ll be flying!
