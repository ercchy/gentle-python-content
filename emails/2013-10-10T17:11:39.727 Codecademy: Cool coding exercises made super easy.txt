Mighty MOOCers,

Introducing Codecademy.

Learning a coding language can be a little intimidating, especially if you’ve never programmed before. There’s special software to download and learn and you need to understand a bit more about how a computer works than the average user. When you’re just getting started, it would be great if you could just ignore all of that and just focus on the basics. With Codecademy ( http://www.codecademy.com/#!/exercises/0 ) , you can. The site provides great exercises for learning Python, Javascript, jQuery, HTML, CSS and lots of other things you may not have heard of–and they all run in your browser without any download or set up. Pretty slick.

What will we be using?

Their Python exercises ( http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/python ) , of course. These are fairly new exercises and the Codecademy team has been working hard to get them ready for the Mechanical MOOC, so be gentle with the Codecademy folks. We’ll be beta testers on this one, so if an exercise doesn’t work the way you expect, help them out by leaving a note in the Q&amp;A Forum in the exercise.

Something to remember.

Codecademy Python exercises are written in Python 2.7, and the rest of the class uses 2.6. The differences should not for the most part affect the class, but you can see what’s different here ( http://docs.python.org/whatsnew/2.7.html ) .

The Mechanical MOOC’s A Gentle Introduction to Python is a collaboration between Peer 2 Peer University ( http://p2pu.org ) , MIT OpenCourseWare ( http://ocw.mit.edu ) , OpenStudy ( http://openstudy.com ) , and Codecademy ( http://codecademy.com ) . For this course, Peer 2 Peer University has developed an email scheduler that coordinates student activity across the participating sites to facilitate collaborative learning. This email was generated by the scheduler. A full archive of emails for this course sequence is available here ( http://mechanicalmooc.wordpress.com/category/seq21oct13/ ) .
