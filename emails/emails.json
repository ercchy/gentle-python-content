With&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.codecademy.com/#!/exercises/0\" target=\"_blank\">Codecademy</a>, you can.

There\u2019s special software to download and learn and you need to understand a bit more about how a computer works than the average user.

With\u00a0Codecademy ( http://www.codecademy.com/#!/exercises/0 ) , you can. The site provides great exercises for learning Python, Javascript, jQuery, HTML, CSS and lots of other things you may not have heard of\u2013and they all run in your browser without any download or set up.

Wise words for aspiring programmers.\n\nThing two.\n\nPlease take five minutes to complete our start of course survey, so we can learn more about who is participating in the course. You can access the survey here: https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/seq21oct13\n\nThanks, and much happy MOOCing.\n\n\u2013MM\n\nTweet #mmooc ( https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?button_hashtag=mmooc ) \u00a0|\u00a0Follow @MOOC_E ( https://twitter.com/MOOC_E ) \u00a0|\u00a0MMOOC Blog ( http://mechanicalmooc.wordpress.com ) \n\nThe Mechanical MOOC\u2019s A Gentle Introduction to Python is a collaboration between\u00a0Peer 2 Peer University ( http://p2pu.org ) ,\u00a0MIT OpenCourseWare ( http://ocw.mit.edu ) ,\u00a0OpenStudy ( http://openstudy.com ) , and\u00a0Codecademy ( http://codecademy.com ) .
