MechMOOCsters,

Week 7–less reading and watching, more coding. This week we will finish up the readings, videos and most of the Codecademy exercises, and begin to focus intensively on projects that will put what we’ve learned to practice in a series of projects. The training wheels are coming off.

Materials:


	Text: Chapter 16 from How to Think Like a Computer Scientist ( http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkpython/thinkCSpy/html/index.html ) 
	Codecademy: Units 17, 18, 19 and 20 ( http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/python ) 


Tasks:


	Complete sections 4.1 – 4.3.3 and Optional Exercises 1 and 2 from Handout 4 ( http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-189-a-gentle-introduction-to-programming-using-python-january-iap-2011/assignments/MIT6_189IAP11_hw4.pdf ) 
	Complete sections 4.4 – 4.6 from Written Exercises 4 of 6.189 A Gentle Introduction to Computer Science ( http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-189-a-gentle-introduction-to-programming-using-python-january-iap-2011/assignments/MIT6_189IAP11_hw4_written.pdf ) 
	Complete Project 2 ( http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-189-a-gentle-introduction-to-programming-using-python-january-iap-2011/assignments/MIT6_189IAP11_project2.pdf ) 


As always, ask for help for help on OpenStudy ( http://openstudy.com )  or from your cluster peers. And remember to hand out medals on OpenStudy to anyone who helps you out!

Keep on coding!
