Good people of the Mechanical MOOC,

About 2,800 of you have signed up for the course. That's a lot of new friends, peer-learners, and mentors. But because it's confusing to go to a party with 2,800 people, we are also putting you together in smaller teams. From our previous experiences we've found the magic number for small groups is 40 Moocsters each. 

What should I share with my small group? Good question. Some ideas:


	Share code projects
	Get feedback on your project ideas
	Pass along additional resources you come across
	Figure out a puzzle or get unstuck


How do I get started with my group? We've already grouped you in a team :)


	Simply reply to this email to get started. 
	Go ahead--hit "reply" and introduce yourself!
