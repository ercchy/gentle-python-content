Brave Mechanical MOOCers,

A mechanical MOOC is unlike other online courses, or MOOCs, you may have taken in that we don’t have a central platform that you log into to access all of your course materials. Instead, we use materials that are already out there and available as open resources. This means you have a bit more to keep track of, but it also allows us to take advantages of some of the features developed by the sites we use. So here are a few tips that can help you keep organized and use some of the great features of our participating sites:


	First, keep organized by creating your own personal learning environment ( http://mechanicalmooc.wordpress.com/2012/10/04/a-tip-on-moocing-mechanically/ ) 
	Second, work offline by accessing downloadable content and mobile features. ( http://mechanicalmooc.wordpress.com/2012/10/10/another-tip-on-moocing-mechanically-mmooc/ ) 
	Third, work in other languages by accessing translated versions ( http://mechanicalmooc.wordpress.com/2012/10/15/a-final-tip-on-moocing-mechanically-mmooc/ )  of some content.


Hopefully this will make your Mechanical MOOC experience easier and more rewarding.
