Hey Mechanical MOOCers,

We hope you’re enjoying week one of the course. Two things as you work your way though the initial tasks:

Thing one.

We can guarantee that learning Python will be equal parts exhilaration and exasperation, and we hope you’ll embrace both as a natural part of the learning process. When you hit the rough parts, we encourage you to read this post ( http://claudiascholz.wordpress.com/2012/09/28/words-of-encouragement-for-mmooc/ )  by Claudia Scholz, Mech MOOC sequence 1 participant and blogger extraordinaire. Wise words for aspiring programmers.

Thing two.

Please take five minutes to complete our start of course survey, so we can learn more about who is participating in the course. You can access the survey here: https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/seq21oct13

Thanks, and much happy MOOCing.

–MM
