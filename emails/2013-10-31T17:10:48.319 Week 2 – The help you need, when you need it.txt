Mechanical MOOCsters,

It’s the second week of class, and you’ve probably got Python questions.  Fortunately, there are tons of people waiting to provide answers.  If you haven’t already registered for the OpenStudy 6.189 group (http://openstudy.com ( http://openstudy.com ) ), you should.  You’ll almost always find learners from the course hanging out there, asking and answering questions.

What’s more, a lot of these learners are from the previous sequences of the course, so they’ve already completed the exercises you are struggling with—and they are excited to share what they’ve learned. Remember to hand out medal to (and become fans of) peers that are helpful to you on OpenStudy.

Part of the magic of the Mechanical MOOC!
