Mechanical MOOCians,

We’ve distributed our last assignment e-mail, and we hope that wherever you are in the course progression, you are enjoying the journey.  Don’t worry that the course assignments are all out, we’re in no hurry for you to go.  Take your time and finish up at your own pace.

In the mean time, we’d love to get your thoughts on the course.  Your input can help future learners have a better experience and help us learn about learning.

We have a short survey we’ve pulled together (30 questions) that should take about ten minutes to answer.  We’d really love your feedback, and as always, participation is voluntary and data will only be shared anonymously.  Here’s the link:

Thanks, now go forth and code!
